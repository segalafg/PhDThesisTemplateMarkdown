## Section title

We write some text here.

To start a new paragraph, you need to leave a blank line between the previous paragraph and the new paragraph.

You might need to include footnotes.^[This is how you include a footnote. The text within the square brackets will appear in the footnote.]

>You might want to indent an entire paragraph and not only the first: by using the '>' symbol, the entire paragraph will be indented. The size of the indentadion is determined by the parindent{} command in the header-includes section at the beginning.

### Subsection title

Some more text here.

#### Subsection level 4 no hspace

R markdown works perfectly up to the third level of section numbering. From the fourth, however, it is not able to format correctly and writes this sentence next to the subsection title, as shown by this sentence. To stop it from doing this, we use the "hspace" command (an example is shown in the next section).

#### Subsection level 4 hspace

\hspace{-2.5em}Hspace places the new paragraph on a new line.

##### Subsection level 5

\hspace{-2.5em} Here is an example of how to write an equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:example}
B = \sqrt{R^2+L^2},
\end{equation}

\noindent Using "noindent" allows you to remove the initial indent for this paragraph.

By using the following command, you can refer to your figure and R markdown will keep the count automatically: see example in Figure \@ref(fig:examplefig1). Additionally, R markdown creates hyperlinks to figures, tables and references, so that, if you click on them, it will take you directly to the figure, table or reference within the reference list. Figures and tables are automatically added to your LoF and LoT.

There are different ways to reference. To include a reference, use the cite key of the reference. I would suggest to format the cite key as \@AuthorDate, so this is what it looks like: @Author2023. As you can see, the reference in the PDF appears as Author (date). To have the reference appear as (Author, date), use square brackets: [@Author2023]. In APA style, if two references have the same authors, R markdown will write them as (Author, date1; date2) automatically: [@Author2023; @Author2024]. To include more references within one square bracket, use a semicolon: [@Author2023; @Author2024; @Author2025]. You can also include some text within a square bracket and a reference. Make sure to use a semicolon between the references if you include multiple ones: [here is an example, @Author2025; @Author2026]. Markdown will automatically compile the reference list at the end of the document.

```{r examplefig1, fig.cap="Figure example. This is how we include a figure in teh text with a caption. With fig.align, you can decide wether to left-aling, right-align or centre it relative to the page. With out.width you can plot your figure in a smaller size than its original size.", fig.align="center", out.width = '70%', echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(figdir,'Example1.pdf'))
```

Finally, here is an example for a table (Table \@ref(tab:exampletable1)).

```{r exampletable1, echo=FALSE}

exptnames <- c('Number 1','Number 2')
zlist <- c(1,1)
klist <- c(2,2)

tabledata <- data.frame(exptnames,zlist,klist)

colnames(tabledata) <- c('Numbers','Ones','Twos')
kable(tabledata, align='lcc',caption = 'Table example. With the command align you can choose how to aling each column. The next lign of code within this chunk allows you to stick the table exactly where you created it.')%>%
  kable_styling(latex_options='HOLD_position')
```

# Appendix 1 {-}

Here is an example of another figure (Figure \@ref(fig:examplefig2)) and another table (Table \@ref(tab:exampletable2)) to show you that the numbering changed for this section.

```{r examplefig2, fig.cap="Figure example for appendix. The figure count is reset for the appendix with the command used at the beginning, so this figure is the first and is set to be A1.1.", fig.align="center", out.width = '80%', echo=FALSE}

```

```{r exampletable2, echo=FALSE}

exptnames <- c('Number 3','Number 4')
zlist <- c(3,3)
klist <- c(4,4)

tabledata <- data.frame(exptnames,zlist,klist)

colnames(tabledata) <- c('Numbers','Threes','Fours')
kable(tabledata, align='lcc',caption = 'Table example 2. Similar to the figure count, the table count is reset and this is the first table.')%>%
